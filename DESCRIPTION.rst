code_monkey
===========

code_monkey is a tool to automate complicated refactoring for large Python
projects. It builds a tree representing your project, then provides an easy API
for querying nodes out of the tree. Once you've found the nodes you're looking
for, you can generate changes and apply them to your whole project at once.
